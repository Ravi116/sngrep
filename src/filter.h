 * @brief Functions to manage filtering options
 *
 * There are two types of filters: capture and display.
 *
 * Capture filters are handled in capture functions and they limit the
 * number of calls are created in sip storage.
 *
 * Display filters are handled in this file and they limit the number of
 * calls that are displayed to the user. Multiple display filters can be
 * set at the same time. In order to be valid, a call MUST match all the
 * enabled filters to be shown.
